                    <p class="mb-5">I have interests in cycling, photography, headphones, and watches. I have a passion for cycling, both as a sport and as a means of exploring the outdoors and staying active. I also have an interest in photography, capturing moments and memories through the lens. I also have an interest in headphones, enjoying listening to music and sound with high-quality equipment. And I have an interest in watches, enjoying the craftsmanship and design of different watches. I also enjoy combining my interests in cycling and photography to capture the beautiful landscapes and moments while I'm exploring on my bike.</p>

                                    What inspires me the most in my work is seeing the tangible impact my work has on the end product. There's a real sense of satisfaction that comes from taking an idea from concept to reality, and being able to see how it benefits and improves the lives of users.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Describe a complex software development issue you have dealt with and how you could resolve it successfully.
                                <ul>
                                    We had a page capable of loading multiple forms dynamically and during conception it was not anticipated that so many forms would cause a slow down. Our solution was simple, simply do not render the forms until needed. The forms were already in a accordion: if open the accordion we render the form, if it was closed we unmount the form freeing resources from the browser.
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Describe how you would handle a situation if you were required to finish multiple tasks by the end of the day, and there was no conceivable way that you could finish them. 
                                <ul>
                                    Firstly, this situation is preventable with proper management and communication. If this really happened, immediate heads and leaders would be informed and we would come up with a plan for catching up on any tasks that cannot be completed today and come up with a priority list of tasks to be completed.
                                </ul>

                                Describe a time when you had to solve a software problem, but you didn’t have all the necessary knowledge about it in hand. How were you able to successfully resolve the issue? 
                                <ul>
                                    Tasked with connecting a business' static website to a Strapi CMS. Conducted research on Strapi and analyzed website structure. Created a plan and broke tasks into smaller manageable ones for efficient completion.

                                <ul>
                                    I had received challenging feedback from a manager in the past. I took the time to reflect on my mistake and proactively put measures in place to ensure it wouldn't happen again in the future.

                                What do you do when a client has trouble explaining their needs? (For example, they don’t provide enough information)
                                <ul>
                                    When facing a client who has difficulty articulating their needs, I approach the situation by conducting research on their business and identifying any pain points. This allows me to ask targeted questions and come up with a solution that effectively addresses their needs.
                                </ul>

                                When faced with uncertainty or ambiguity in a project, how do you make decisions and take action? Please provide an example of situation where you had to make a quick decision in an uncertain environment.
                                <ul>
                                    Faced a client from a previous employer where the requirements were vague and uncertain. To help with this, we had a meeting with the client, future users of the system, the dev team and our project manager. In this meeting we discussed the client's problems and expectations while the dev team brainstormed potential solutions, we made sure that the environment and the teams fostered open communications. We decided to go with an Agile approach, showing the client flexible and modular features each meeting. Going Agile allowed for adjustments based on user feedback and changing requirements.

                                Please describe any teamwork, management, and/or leadership experience you have. Include details about your role and the size and structure of the team. (How many people, what kind of composition is the team, etc.) 
                                <ul>
                                    I lead a small team composed of 3 people (including myself) on a project in Rococo. I was the lead developer and the project was to create an asset management system using ServiceNow. This was used by Kosé sales agents in Japan.

                                    I have used React.js, React-native, Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel, and most recently Next.js. My strengths are in React.js and Next.js. My experience with databases is mainly with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
